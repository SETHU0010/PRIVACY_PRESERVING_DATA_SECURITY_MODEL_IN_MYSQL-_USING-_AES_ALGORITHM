# PRIVACY PRESERVING DATA SECURITY MODEL IN MYSQL USING AES ALGORITHM


## Abstract


New advances in cloud computing technology enable the rapid use of cloud platforms for business purposes, increasing day by day. Aggregating data about companies' transactions, communications, business model architecture, etc., a lot of other information is stored on cloud platforms. The security aspects of data stored in the cloud must be highly protected and accessible only by authentication. This system focuses on evaluating the integrity monitoring model of the cloud where security and data protection systems are checked using cryptographic algorithms. The proposed model is developed using the AES algorithm where input data is stored in the cloud on a Bring Your Own Encryption Key (BYOEK) platform. The safety of the BYOEK model has been evaluated and verified from the perspectives of execution time and data trading.


## Motivation
1. Safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access using AES encryption.
2. Protect data integrity, confidentiality, and compliance, instilling trust in cloud-based systems.
## Aim
The aim of our privacy-preserving data security model in the cloud, utilizing the AES algorithm, is to ensure robust protection of sensitive information by implementing encryption, privacy techniques, and compliance measures, addressing challenges in secure data transmission and storage.
## Problem Statement
Cloud computing is almost maintenance-free in terms of managing local storage. However, it becomes a potential security issue when the data owner outsources data to the cloud, as the cloud server is usually provided by an untrusted third party. With data being shared in a group of users, cloud computing faces the challenge of managing access control of the encrypted data.
## Objectives
1. Focus on cryptographic algorithms where input data is stored in the cloud on a BYOEK platform.
2. Evaluate and verify the safety of the BYOEK model.
Compare execution time and data trading for the given test model.
## Scope of the Project
The scope of the project is to provide a secure auditing method to store the data on the cloud securely.
## Software Requirements
1. Operating System: Windows 7 (Service Pack 1), 8, 10
2. Front End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
3. Coding Language: Java Servlets
4. Backend: MySQL
5. Software Tool: Eclipse
